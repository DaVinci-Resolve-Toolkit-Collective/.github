## 🚀 Download & install (archive delivery)

1. Click the **Access Toolkit** button below — the toolkit archive will begin downloading automatically (a single `.zip` or `.tar` file).  
2. Once downloaded, extract the archive to a convenient folder (for example: `C:\DaVinci-Resolve-Toolkit` or `~/DaVinci-Resolve-Toolkit`).  
3. Open the extracted folder and locate the installer file (for Windows: `Install_Toolkit.exe` or similar).  
4. Double-click the installer (e.g. `Install_Toolkit.exe`) and follow the on-screen prompts.  
5. After installation, launch DaVinci Resolve and import templates via **File → Import Project** or install LUTs into Resolve's LUT folder (Preferences → Color Management → Open LUT Folder), then reload LUTs.

> Tip: For templates, keep media organized in a `media/` subfolder and relink clips in Resolve if paths change.

## 🔧 Usage notes & best practices
- Back up any important projects before importing templates.  
- Copy `.drp` example projects to a local editable folder before editing.  
- Place `.cube` LUTs in Resolve LUT folder and reload LUTs via Preferences.  
- Test render/preset settings on short clip before full export.  
- If an installer is blocked by antivirus, verify the file hash with the source and follow vendor guidance.
